# Technical Background
## My Techniccal background is mostly Python. That is the langauage I have done the most work with, and then I also have some experice with C in previous classes. I enjoy using python more because I am more familar with it. I have also used an HDL (Hardware Description Language) for FPGAs called Verilog I don't recommend it though. It was not a good experience.
